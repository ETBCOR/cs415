/// The `TournamentSelector` implements the tournament selection method.
/// It runs tournaments with a small size of participants and pick the best
/// performing individuals from each tournament.
///
/// The number of participants in each tournament is configurable by the
/// `tournament_size` field. A tournament size of 1 is called 1-way tournament
/// and is equivalent to random selection.
///
/// The final selection is picked from the best performing participants in each
/// tournament but with a probability. The probability gives also chances to
/// the second best, third best and so on. The probability is configurable by
/// the `probability` field. A probability of 1.0 means the tournament is
/// deterministic. The best and only the best individual of each tournament is
/// selected.
///
/// To avoid that candidates chosen once are selected again they are removed
/// from the list of candidates. Though this can be configured as well. The
/// field `remove_selected_individuals` controls whether selected candidates
/// are removed or not.
///
/// This `TournamentSelector` can be used for single-objective fitness values
/// as well as multi-objective fitness values.
