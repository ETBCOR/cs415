//! The `proportionate` module provides `operator::SelectionOp`s that implement
//! stochastic fitness proportionate selection strategies. Individuals are
//! randomly selected. Individuals with a higher `genetic::Fitness` value are
//! having a higher probability to be selected.
//!
//! How is this achieved?
//! In fitness proportionate selection each individual gets assigned a weight
//! that is equal to its fitness value plus the sum of fitness values of all
//! individuals in the list before him (cumulative weight distribution). Then
//! a uniform random number between 0 and the sum of all weights is used to
//! select a candidate.
//!
//! The provided **fitness proportionate selection** operators are:
//! * `RouletteWheelSelector` - no bias - does not guarantee minimal spread.
//! * `UniversalSamplingSelector` - no bias - minimal spread.
