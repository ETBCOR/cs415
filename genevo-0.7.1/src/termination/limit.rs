//! The `limiter` package provides `Termination` functions that stop the
//! simulation when a certain limit is reached.
//!
//! Provided limiters are:
//! * `FitnessLimit` - stops the simulation after a solution with a certain
//!   fitness has been found.
//! * `IterationLimit` - stops the simulation after a maximum number of
//!   iterations has been processed.
//! * `TimeLimit` - stops the simulation after a the specified time limit
//!   has been reached.
