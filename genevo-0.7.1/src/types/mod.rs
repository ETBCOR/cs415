//! This module provides implementations of the `genetic::Fitness` trait for
//! some primitive types, such as `i32`, `i64` et cetera.
//! This is because Rust does not allow programmers to implement
//! a foreign trait for a foreign type, which would stop you as a library user
//! from using primitive types as fitness values.
//!
//! Implemented types:
//!
//! * `i8`
//! * `i16`
//! * `i32`
//! * `i64`
//! * `isize`
//! * `u8`
//! * `u16`
//! * `u32`
//! * `u64`
//! * `usize`
